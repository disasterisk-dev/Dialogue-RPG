# Dialogue Role Playing Game
Dialogue is a web-based “tabletop” RPG that encourages players to improvise narrative and dialogue collaboratively. The game is played by one Game Master (GM) and up to four players. The GM will draw prompt cards from several decks and use the prompt to improvise a narrative for the players, drawing new cards as needed to keep up the narrative's momentum.

Because the focus of the game is improvisational dialogue the ruleset is fairly unobtrusive. Players create characters with stats based around personality, speech, and intellect much in the same way that traditional tabletop games use physical stats like strength or dexterity. 

Whenever the GM feels it suitable they can call on the players to make “skill checks”, where the player will roll a digital dice and have their score combined with a modifier value based on their characters’ traits. The GM can decide if the resulting score is sufficient for the player to succeed at their discretion.

Traditional Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) combat is largely absent from gameplay, however, as physical violence is a mainstay of most genres available there are rules to account for combat occurring in the game. The layers should aim to limit the frequency and length of fights to maintain the focus and flow of the narrative.
